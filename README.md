Udacity DSND Project on writing a Data Science Blog Post

## Overview

This project is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree. The aim of the project is to demostrate knowlege of the CRISP-DM Process for Data Analysis and Data Mining, be able to follow the process and then communicate your findings effectively and clearly to an audience.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains the following folders and files:

The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis following the CRISP-DM process.

Inside the models folder is the work related to the Machine Learning pipeline, and includes the original ML Jupyter notebook, the python script derived from the notebook in train_classifier.py. The final trained model output saved as a pickle file called classifier.pkl is not included in the repository due to size restrictions.

Inside the app folder is the web app with the python script to run the app called run.py and then a template folder containing the two front-end html files master.html and go.html.

## Dependencies

   - pandas 0.23.3
   - numpy 1.12.1
